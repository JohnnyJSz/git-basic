    <article id="sshKeys">
        <h3>SSH Keys</h3>
        <p>In order to push the changes under our account we have to proof to GitHub that we are "the owners of our
            account" (connect our local machine to GitHub)</p>
        <p>How? Using the <strong>SSH KEYS</strong> <br>We have to start by generating a key locally using the
            ssh-keygen command</p>
        <p><i>ssh-keygen</i></p>
        <p>the type of encryption</p>
        <p><i>ssh-keygen -t rsa</i></p>
        <p>the strength of encryption</p>
        <p><i>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</i></p>
        <p>and our GitHub email address</p>
        <p><i>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"</i></p>
        <p>Now the default file for the ssh key is inside our user directory in the <i>.ssh/</i> directory and its
            called <i>id_rsa</i></p>
        <p>Now the key is generated. If we check our key we find out there is two keys (both the same but one with the
            extension .pub). Is that one the one we are going to upload to our GitHub interface.</p>
        <p>We have to print out and copy the public key. It could start with 'ssh-rsa' and it is a very long chain of
            characters ending with the email linked to our GitHub account</p>
        <p>Once we have the key on the clipboard, we have to go to GitHub web site > user > settings > SSH and GPG keys
            > New SHH key > here we have to paste the key.</p>
        <p>The only thing left to do it's to make sure that our local Git CLI knows about the key we just generated. For
            that simply follow the steps in the following link <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent"

    <article id="gitPush">
        <h3>Git Push</h3>
        <p>To push to GitHub we have to type in the Terminal <i>git push origin master</i></p>
        <p><i>origin</i> is an option set for us here and stands for the location of our git repository.</p>
        <p><i>master</i> is the branch that we want to push to.</p>

    <article id="startRepositoryLocally">
        <h3>Start a repository locally</h3>
        <p>So far we have been doing commits to practice, that was part of a demonstration of how to create a new git
            repository using GitHub but what about if we start a repository locally?</p>
        </br>
        <p>Lets create a new folder, separated from the previous repository, lets called it
            <i>demo-repo</i> and lets move into it. Now this is not a Git repository yet, nothing is in there.</p>
        <p>Lets add a test file and add some content to it.</p>
        <p>To turn that folder and its content into a git repo we have to type <i>git init</i>.</p>
        <p>After some changes we follow the same steps to commit <i>status / add / commit / push origin master</i> and
            we are going to face an error </br> "fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository" </br> and </br>
            "fatal: Could not read from remote repository."</p>
        <p>This is because we created it locally and there is no repo on GitHub to push to, it is not connected to
            anything. So we have to create that connection.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to do this is by creating an empty git repo up on github.com, once we have it we need to copy
            the SSH key, after that we hay to type in the Terminal <i>git remote add origin "shh key from
                github.com"</i> and then we can check the repositories that we have connected to this repo using the
            command <i>git remote -v</i></p>
        <p>Now we have all set up we can use <i>git push origin master</i>, there is a shortcut for that but we have to
            set something called an <i>upstream</i> meaning this is where I want to push it to by default, we can set
            the shortcut with <i>git push -u origin master</i> and then the next time in the future we can use <i>git
                push</i> only.</p>
        <p>After that if we refresh the github website we will find the repository updated.</p>
